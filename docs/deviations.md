# Deliberate deviations from Tera Term

Everything else in this project is a transcription, and `AGENTS.md`'s traps are
the record of how carefully. This file is the other list: the places where
Sterna does something Tera Term does not **on purpose**, with the reason, so
that a future reader diffing the two programs can tell a decision from a bug.

The rule for being on this list: the divergence is user-visible, it is not
forced by the platform, and reproducing upstream instead would be strictly
easy. A divergence forced by Linux or by Qt is not a deviation — it is a port,
and it belongs in a comment at the code and in `AGENTS.md` if it bites.

Compatibility is unaffected by everything below: no key changes meaning, and a
`TERATERM.INI` written by either program still opens correctly in the other.

| # | Deviation | Upstream | Since |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The default baud rate is 115200 | 9600 | unreleased |

## 1. The default baud rate is 115200

`BaudRate`'s default is 115200 where `ttset.c:919` gives 9600.

**Why.** 9600 is the speed a serial console had when Tera Term chose it. The
equipment this program is pointed at — a router, a switch, a BMC, an embedded
board over an FTDI cable — ships 115200, and 9600 is now the exception that
gets typed in rather than the rule that gets left alone. A default nobody keeps
is a default that costs one dialog visit per install.

**What is unchanged.** The key, its absence of bounds, and what a value in the
file means. `BaudRate=9600` opens at 9600 in both programs; a file written by
either is read the same way by the other. Only the value used when the key is
absent differs.

**Where it lives.** `schema/settings.txt`'s `serial.baud` row, and
`SerialParams::default()` in `tt-conn`, which is what the C ABI's
`tt_serial_params_default` hands a frontend. The serial dialog reads the shipped
speed from the ABI rather than carrying a literal of its own, so there is one
place to change and it is the schema.
